// Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.

// To do this, you’ll need to know when any team is having a meeting. In HiCal, a meeting is stored as objects ↴ with integer properties startTime and endTime. These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.

function mergeRanges(meetings) {
  // Create a deep copy of the meetings array
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign#Deep_Clone
  const meetingsCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(meetings));

  // Sort by start time
  const sortedMeetings = meetingsCopy.sort((a, b) => {
    return a.startTime - b.startTime;
  });

  // Initialize mergedMeetings with the earliest meeting
  const mergedMeetings = [sortedMeetings[0]];

  for (let i = 1; i < sortedMeetings.length; i++) {
    const currentMeeting = sortedMeetings[i];
    const lastMergedMeeting = mergedMeetings[mergedMeetings.length - 1];

    // If the current meeting overlaps with the last merged meeting, use the
    // later end time of the two
    if (currentMeeting.startTime <= lastMergedMeeting.endTime) {
      lastMergedMeeting.endTime = Math.max(
        lastMergedMeeting.endTime,
        currentMeeting.endTime
