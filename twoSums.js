/* 
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


i: nums array, and sum value
o: array with indeces of eles that add up to target num
c: none
e: array length is 1, array length is empty

var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
